### Little about me.

I have grown up in Imom-ota village which is one of the most beautiful places
of Andijan and it is considered as a touristic zone and welcomes a lot of
people visiting there every summer around Uzbekistan. Its surrounding of
mountains makes it so astounding and this is what i most like about my
hometown.
