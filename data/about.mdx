### Hi, I am Asilbek Anvarbekov

<br />
<br />

I am from Uzbekistan, resides in Andijan province and am 21 years old.

<br />

I am a Mern Full Stack Web Developer, Javascript Engineer, UI and UX Designer, Languages and Calithenics enthusiast.

<br />

I am a self-taught programmer and have been programming since 2019. The way i have been learning these skills is to follow the official documentations, listening to other professionals, watching videos on Youtube and actually coding and practicing.

<br />

These days i am using NEXT JS as my preference of a full stack web framework for any web apps i build.

<br />

A quick recap.

<br />

Next is a full stack web framework built on top of React JS and Node JS. You can
expect everything that is on React and Node. It makes a lot easy for me to integrate
the backend with frontend since it came together as one with built-in features. NEXT
JS stands out to have built-in features likes:

- Pre-rendered Static Pages
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Incremental Static Generation (ISG)
- Server Side Rendering (SSR)

As of React 18, Next JS 12 came with Server Side Components and othes biggest improvements ever Next JS Team released.

<br />

There is a lot to talk about and has already been spoken by other professionals. To put it simply, Next JS does improve site performance, use experience by handling all the heavy lifts by default is super fast and i love everything about NEXT.

<br />
<br />

### Little about me.

<br />

I have grown up in Imom-ota village which is one of the most beautiful places
of Andijan and it is considered as a touristic zone and welcomes a lot of
people visiting there every summer around Uzbekistan. Its surrounding of
mountains makes it so astounding and this is what i most like about my
hometown.
