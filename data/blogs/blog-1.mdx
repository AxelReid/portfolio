I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

```js
// lib/docs.js

import fs from 'fs'
import { join } from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

export function getDocBySlug(slug) {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.md$/, '')
  const docsDirectory = join(process.cwd(), 'docs')
  const fullPath = join(docsDirectory, `${realSlug}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents)

  return { slug: realSlug, meta: data, content }
}
```

> Talent42 is the national conference focused 100% on helping recruiters hire top technology talent. We bring you keynotes from engineering leaders, tech recruiting leader presentations and panels, hands-on roundtables, and training. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Target, Costco, Uber, Disney, Nike, NBC, Etsy, and many search firms send their tech recruiting teams to participate in this practical, how-to conference that’s all about sourcing, interviewing, and closing the best tech talent on earth.

Angie wanted me to come out to Seattle and speak at Talent42 to share an engineer's perspective on technical recruiting.
Coincidentally, one of my goals for 2019 was to speak at a national conference. _Challenge accepted!_
