There are alot of questions people asking about what to learn to be a web developer or what technologies should i learn in 2021 or does this programming language have a future and stuff like that. Howeover, there are already alot of answers though by professionals.

<br />

But, let me share with my knowledge about Web Development in 2021. In the first place, when to talk about building a website you can't image it without html, css and javascript, so without knowing them well you can't anywhere long and whatever field you are choosing you should must highly consider its core technologies, like in our case of web development as we mentioned they are `html`, `css` and `javascript`. So, my first advice depending on my experience, **You must master these skills, yeah really master them**. If you have a strong fundamentals, when you want to learn a library like React js, it will take on a month or two to be confortable with it.
